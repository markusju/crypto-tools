# crypto-tools
This is a collection of tools created as part of assignments during Prof. Weber's lecture "Security & Cryptography" at Saarland University of Applied Sciences (htw saar)
* [prime-order](prime-order): Allows to determine generators for multiplicative groups mod n
* [ddt](ddt): Difference Distribution Table for differential crypto-analysis of symmetric block ciphers.
* [lfsr](lfsr): Linear-Feedback-Shift-Register implementation of a stream cipher.
* [block-cipher](block-cipher): A simple Block-cipher "Cipher TWO"

We also created other tools you might be interested in: 
* [elliptic-curves](https://github.com/markusju/elliptic-curves/): A straight-forward implementation of ECC, with many examples
* [pollard-rho](https://github.com/markusju/pollard-rho/): An Implementation of Pollard's Rho algorithm for finding discrete logarithms.
